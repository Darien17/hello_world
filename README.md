# hello_world

This is just a test repository so I can figure out how the system works, since I'm new to GitHub.

I normally try C++ since that's what I was trained in, but I'm looking at branching out to Ruby,
since the company I work for programs in that and I'd like to move up to being a developer.  Java
is also popular, and I'm unfamiliar with it.

Anyway, let's get this ball rolling!
